# What's New to Tickets For Good?
## A tool to check if new events have been added since the last time you checked.

Tickets for Good has no capability for listing its events by date added. As a result it can be difficult to discover newly added events - a particular issue for popular events that might sell out fast.
This script intends to give the user the upper hand by showing newly added events in the matter of seconds.
The script compiles all events on the website at a given point in time and then compares to the events from the users last search. Events that were not in the last search are then printed to show what's new!
